# Managing a Club

Hello community builder! Reference below on the workflows and features associated with managing a club.

## Club Page
Clicking on your club in the navigation bar will bring you to your club page. This is a centralized place for you and your members to view club information, including the description of the club, location, events, announcements, and officers. It is possible to customize this page if you are an officer using markdown to move text and components around as it fits your vision.

## Events
You can't have a club without events. These include regular meetings, special events, or just a way to tell your members that something is happening at a place and time. Each event has a special event page that users can register for. We support both online and in-person events.
